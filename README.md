Hey there!

Welcome to my Avengers-themed website! This project is something I put together to test my skills in HTML and a little bit of CSS styling, and I’m super excited to share it with you.

Here’s what you’ll find:

A fully responsive design that looks great on any device, whether you’re on your phone, tablet, or desktop.
A touch of creativity with an animated Avengers logo—because why not make it dynamic and fun?
Some awesome images of Avengers characters (all sourced online), which really bring the theme to life.
What did I use?
It’s all done with HTML5 and CSS3—no fancy frameworks, just good old code to build and style everything, plus some media queries to make it responsive.

Want to check it out?
All you need to do is open the index.html file in your browser, and boom—you’re in!

This project is just for fun and educational purposes, but I’d love to hear your feedback or ideas to make it even better!

Enjoy!
